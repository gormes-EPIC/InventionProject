## Objective

1. Create a invention that combines both software and hardware components to perform a useful function.
2. Demonstrate the Python and circuit building skills we learned this semester in a transformative manner
3. Research new components and libraries to add to your project
4. Create technical documentation your project using and industry tools
5. Communicate about your project to a non-technical audience

## Part 1: The Idea

Working alone or in a team of 2, brainstorm some ideas for your invention. You project must contain **at least one source of input and at least one source of output**. Also, your project must contain **at least one new component** you have not used before. 

If you are working in teams of 2, your team needs 2 different sources of input, 2 different sources of output, and two new components you have never used before.

### A Look at the Final Project

Here are a few examples of projects from former students. The requirements for your project will be slightly different than these examples, but they should help you get a sense of the scope.

- [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/miloskud/Tic-Tac-Toe-Project) 
- [Plant Guardian](https://kcook204.gitbook.io/plant-waterhelper)

Here is my example for the final documentation for this project. 

- [Proximity Sensor](https://github.com/gormes-EPIC/ProximitySensor/tree/main)

If you can't come up with an idea, I have some that you are welcome to use.

### Completing Part 1

Once you have your idea, answer the following questions. *You will use the answers to these questions directly in final documentation.*

1. In one to two sentences, how would you summarize your invention to someone with no experience in computer science?
2. In a short paragraph, explain how your project will perform this function. Assume the reader has some technical experience.
3. List the supplies you will need.

- [ ] Solidify your project idea, get it approved, and answer the questions

## Part 2: The Plan

 Now that you have chosen an idea, it is time to create a plan for your build. During this step you will create a list of concrete "to do's"  or "checkpoints" for your project. 

### Creating the Steps

Brainstorm some possible **concrete** steps. These may change as you move through your project, but they should give you a good guideline to work from. This step can also help you figure out what is a reasonable scope for your project. If you complete 1-2 items every class, how many classes will it take you? If you are working in teams of 2, you may want to use these steps to delegate responsibilities. If we get to the end of the semester and your project doesn't work as intended, this step will help you communicate what your project can actually do. 

For the proximity stoplight from earlier, the steps might be: 

1. Find a tutorial with wiring instructions and code to use an ultrasonic distance sensor
2. Write a program that prints out the reading from an ultrasonic distance sensor every second
3. Add a LED to the circuit 
4. Modify to the program to turn on the light when your hand is less than 10 cm from the sensor
5. Modify the program again to turn the light off when your hand is not less than 10 cm from the sensor
6. etc.

Copy your list of steps or a link to your list of steps here:

## Part 3: The Build

Now it's time to build your project. As you build, cross items off your list of steps as you work (but don't delete them!! Use a strike-through or other formatting to indicate they were completed). You may find it useful to select one of two items from the list every class so you stay on track.

**While you are building,** please take progress photos and videos periodically!

Also, **save the link to any resources** you used here. You will need to include them in your write up:

1. 

### Creating Tests

Once you get about 50% - 75% of the way through your build, you may be ready to create some test cases. 

Think about your original idea. What are some ways you can measure the success of your project?

Fill in a list of tests you will use for your project. Don't just think about the obvious conditions, what should your program do when it encounters an unexpected event?(Your answer cannot be that it errors) Include both the test conditions and the expected result:

### Finishing Your Build

Once your invention passes your tests, you're done! Now you are ready to take more pictures/videos to complete the documentation. Also, don't forget to upload your code to GitHub!

- [ ] Invention project passes tests as written, functionality is documented through photos and videos, and code is uploaded GitHub, and list of resources is complete

## Documentation

You will now create a professional `README` for your project. The audience of this documentation is other students like you. You can assume they have some background with Python, but you still want to be clear and concise. 

Your document should include the following sections: 

1. **About the project** - *this is where you use your answers from Part 1 and include one of your videos of what it does*
2. **List of materials** 
3. **How to wire** - *include written instructions with visual aids*
4. **How to run your program** - *this should include steps written for beginners. Feel free to use screenshots here two*
5. **What does the code do** - *either add comments to your Python file in the repository already, or copy your code into this Markdown file and add comments. These should explain your code.*
6. **Resources** - *you don't need to do a full citation, just the link and the title is fine.*

This document should be written in professional language, as it is the main project that will represent you to employees. My hope is that you will be able to use this project on your resume, so you want it to be professional!

## Demonstration

During finals week, you will be presenting your project to students from other pathways. 

## Rubric
